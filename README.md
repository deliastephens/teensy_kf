# Teensy KF

An implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter for the Teensy microcontroller + IMU.

## Startup
If you can run the labs, you should be able to run these files! 

Simply download this repository, install the `teensyimu` library using the [following instructions](https://github.com/plusk01/teensyimu). If any other packages are required, you may also install them.

Then, run the jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook should already have generated plots to view, or you can run it with your own Teensy.
